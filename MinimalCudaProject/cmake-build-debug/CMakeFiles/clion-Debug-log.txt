-- The CUDA compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (project):
  The CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER:

    /usr/local/cuda-12.1/bin/nvcc

  is not a full path to an existing compiler tool.

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "CUDACXX" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER to the full
  path to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
