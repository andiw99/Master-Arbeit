/*
 * So instead of the complicated runge kutta scheme we start with the euler mayurama
 * i hopoe this gpu stuff works with SDEs, i am worried about the generation of the random numbers.
 * instead of x_(n+1) = x_n + 1/6 * dt * (k_1 + 2_k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) we
 * only need  x_(n+1) = x_n + k_1 dt + theta sqrt(dt)
 * I think i will try to achieve this flexible implementation of the paper
 * what do we need?
 * - Representation: needs to be an template parameter since we want to swap the containers from cpu to gpu and vice versa
 * - We need memeory management, meaning the allocation of the state vectors etc, but i think cuda and thrust will handle
 *      this on its own
 * - We need the vector iteration which is not entirely trivial for execution on gpu's since we have to iterate
 *      simultaneously over all lattice sites
 * - We need a gpu implementation of the operation that takes place on the lattice sites.
 */


/*
 * Now lets think about the algebra for a 'normal' implementation first
 * Am I mistaken or do I need to make sure that I iterate over every lattice site in the algebra?
 * But i thought the algebra that was given in the paper would work for arbitrary state types, but i cannot imagine
 * how this would work here. maybe i would have to typedef or define a custom state_type that can be initialized
 * with just N and can be iterated through with only using container[i] instead of container[i, j]
 * Or i am overthinking it and i just specialize for 2D
